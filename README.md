# HOF Transpiler

Home office forms transpiler is a tiny tool that can be used as part of a build or manually to convert multipart locales files into one default.json. This is used in our stack for translations of form applications.

## Installation


```npm install --save-dev hof-transpiler```

## Usage

```
hof-transpiler [source dir|glob] {OPTIONS}

       --shared, -s  A path or glob to a directory of shared translations

  --writeShared, -w  Generate a built JSON file of the the shared
                     translations. Default setting is false.

```

## Example

Lets say you have a directory such as: ```translations/src/en```

Which contains:
```
buttons.json
emails.json
errors.json
validation.json
```

If you run hof-transpiler against the directory ```hof-transpiler ./translations/src```

It will iterate through src and for each directory it will create a new directory at the root level with a built default.json file ```translations/en/default.json```

Which will look something like

```
{
  "buttons": {
    json blob from buttons.json
  },
  "emails": {
    json blob from emails.json
  },
  "errors": {
    json blob from errors.json
  },
  "validation": {
    json blob from validation.json
  }
}
```

This is used further down the hof stack for application translations.

## Advanced example - duplicate keys between source folder and shared folder

Lets say you have a directory such as: ```translations/src/en```

Which contains:
buttons.json containing:
```json
{
  "unusual-button": "Moo"
}
```
emails.json containing:
```json
{
  "customer-email": "Hi how are you?"
}
```

And you also have a directory of shared translations such as: ```shared-translations/src/en```

Which contains:
buttons.json containing:
```json
{
  "common-button": "Click me"
}
```

If you then run:
```bash
hof-transpiler translations/src -w --shared shared-translations/src
```

Then transpiled translations should appear in translations/en/default.json as follows:
```json
{
  "buttons": {
    "unusual-button": "Moo",
    "common-button": "Click me"
  },
  "emails": {
    "customer-email": "Hi how are you?"
  }
}
```

Note how a deep merge is performed between the json, with key value pairs from "buttons" being included from both files.

## Multiple shared sources

hof-transpiler supports multiple shared sources, extending them from right to left. This is useful if you have translations shared between applications, and additional shared translations between routes within an application.

If you have the following sources:

node_modules/hof-template-partials/translations/src/en/buttons.json
```json
{
  "continue": "Continue",
  "skip": "Skip",
  "submit": "Submit",
  "abort": "Abort"
}
```

common/translations/src/en/buttons.json
```json
{
  "skip": "Skip this step",
  "cancel": "Cancel"
}
```

my-application/translations/src/en/buttons.json
```json
{
  "continue": "Go Forth!"
}
```

If you then run:
```bash
hof-transpiler my-application/translations/src -w --shared common/translations/src --shared node_modules/hof-template-partials/translations/src
```

You will end up with the following compiled files:

node_modules/hof-template-partials/translations/en/default.json
```json
{
  "buttons": {
    "continue": "Continue",
    "skip": "Skip",
    "submit": "Submit",
    "abort": "Abort"
  }
}
```

common/translations/en/default.json
```json
{
  "buttons": {
    "continue": "Continue",
    "skip": "Skip this step",
    "submit": "Submit",
    "abort": "Abort",
    "cancel": "Cancel"
  }
}
```

my-application/translations/en/default.json
```json
{
  "buttons": {
    "continue": "Go Forth!",
    "skip": "Skip this step",
    "submit": "Submit",
    "abort": "Abort",
    "cancel": "Cancel"
  }
}
```
